This thing is pretty cursed but it works well enough.
I could probably have done a better job with the rendering because it flickers
a bit. Whatever.


### How to run it

```
$ make
```

### Rant

Java was having a real issue building my things consistently even when I put it
into a package. I kept on getting half built stuff which really messed with my
debug process.
Made a cursed `Makefile` that just builds all of them even if they're not out of
date.
